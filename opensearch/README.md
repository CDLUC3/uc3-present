----

CDL was explicitly created as a central unit within the 
UC system with a mission to coordinate, leverage, and amplify the experience, expertise, and capabilities of its partners.

----

### CDL has 4 active programs:

- Publishing & Special Collections
- Discovery & Delivery
- Collections & Licensing
- UC Curation Center (UC3)

## Background

---

## The Log4J incident

Raised the priority to improve our logging systems to 
- be able to patch and address security vulnerabilities
- inconsistent logging across our microservices
- distributed environment

----

## Logging Needs
- Find specific error events in logs 
- Compute key event metrics
- Discover unreported errors

----

## Discussion: Your Logging Needs

---

## Why Opensearch for Logs?

----

## Need for Consolidated Logging

- CDL had Splunk
- Developement teams did not have access
- CDL is an AWS shop

---

## What is OpenSearch?

----

## An OpenSource fork of Elastic

- AWS is steering the development

----

## An OpenSource for of the ELK Stack

- Elastic
- Logstash
- Kibana

----

## OpenSearch

- OpenSearch
- Logstash
- OpenSearch Dashboards

----

## Other Concepts

- Elastic Common Schema (ECS)
- json standard way of generating logs
- used in open telemetry initiatives
- common language support

---

## Log Exploration

----

## Find specific error events in logs 

- High avalability services (multiple instances)
- Eventual migration to containers - log directories will be less accessible

----

## Compute key event metrics

- How widely are functions utilized
- Frequency that functions are utilized
- Metric totals

----

----

## Discover unreported errors

- Aggregate counts by return code

----

## Discussion: Your Logging Tools

----

## As we ingested logs...

- We realized that OpenSearch is a great visualization tool
- for OUR DATA, not just our logs

----

## As we explored data in OpenSearch

- We realized that it could be a great SEARCH tool
- for OUR DATA, not just our logs

---

## OpenSearch - Our Learning Process

----

## Docker distribution of OpenSearch

----

## Creating a tutorial to understand the components

- https://github.com/CDLUC3/opensearch-tutorial

----

## OpenSearch as an AWS managed service (for logs)

- internal users only
- log data may be unsanitized - must keep secure

----

## Types of logs

- Application logs
- Load balancer logs
- Serverless application logs
- Application firewall logs
- System logs
- Logstash logs

----

## Discussion: what types of logs do you have

----

## Log Ingest Challengs

- Crazy regular expressions
- Application inconsistency
  - need for ECS
- Logs that are not log files

----

## Visualizing Logs

- Demo: Merritt Visualization

----

## Log Dashboards

- Visualization
- Filters
- Sample log records

----

## Demo: Merritt Application Logs

- filters
- timelines
- selected columns
- aggregate countts

----

## Discussion - How do you explore log files

----

## Demo: Load Balancer Logs

----

## Demo: Web Application Firewall Logs

----

## What about Data?

- Demo: Merritt cumulative ingests

----

## OpenSearch as an AWS manage service (for data)

- deploy to end users
- different security challenges

---

## UC3 Team Collaboration and Process

----

## EZID Demo

- add video of search tool

----

## DMP Tool - Open Search

- add video if applicable

----

## Discussion: What stories could you tell by visualizing your application data?

---

## Open Search Community Engagement

- Slack channel
- Community Meetings
