# Adopting Monthly Operational Review Meetings as a Learning Exercise

## Category

## Criteria

*Against the ever-changing landscape of cyber security, how do teams on your campus work together and stay on top of new threats and educate the community on how not to fall victim while also protecting individual privacy and data?*

## Abstract
Staying on top of security threats and operational issues can be an overwhelming challenge and a tedious challenge.

In order to make this task more interesting for our team, the Merritt Digital Preservation Team at the California Digital Library has approached this challenge by scheduling a series of monthly operational review meetings for our development team.  

1. Operational Metrics Review (Server Performance)
2. Log File Review (Using consolidated log file dashboards)
3. Software Dependency Review (vulnerabilities reports and software end of life review)

These meetings are attended by our 3 software developers, our product manager, our manager, and our DevOps engineer.  Conducting these meetings as a group makes the meet more fun, more educational for the team, and the team holds each other accountable to a common set of goals.

For each of these meetings, the team follows a script that identifies the key items and hyperlinks to be reviewed.  The script exists as a markdown file that can be quickly modified.  Each of the meetings has a 30 minute time limit. At the end of each meeting, the team refines the script to improve the focus of our next review meeting. 

In the course of each review meeting, the team captures action items and issues which are added to our project board.

In this presentation, the presenter will describe the general approach that the team has adopted for these operational review meetings.  Additionally, the presenter will share sample scripts the team follows for each of these meetings along with sample graphs, charts, and links that the team reviews at each meeting.

## Theme

Our project team consists of 3 developers and one project manager.  None of us are security experts. By approaching our system's operational and security review as a collaborative learning exercise, our system and our team has grown more mature in our operational and security practices.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand how a rhythm of regular review meetings can build expertise and confidence with a team.
2. Understand how a meeting script can facilitate a meeting and facilitate the learning process.
3. Understand how incremental documentation improvements can provide a record of the team's collective learning.
